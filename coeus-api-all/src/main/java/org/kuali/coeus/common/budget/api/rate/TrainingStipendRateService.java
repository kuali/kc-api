     * The Training Stipend Rate's career level must be equal to the passed in career level.
     * The Training Stipend Rate's experience level must be equal to the passed in experience level.

     * is returned.  This is considered the "closest match".
     *
     * Note: that this method only considers the date portion of a {@link Date} for effective date comparisons.
     * Also note that a TrainingStipendRate without an effective date will never be considered a match.
     *
     * @param effectiveDate the effective date of the training stipend rate must be less than or equal to.  Cannot be null.
     * @param careerLevel the career level of the training stipend rate. Cannot be blank.
